Welcome to my blog. I'm Daniel, alias 'dib' for short. I'm an old soul in the world of internet, and decided to make a blog to share my knowledge to everyone.

If you might wonder what's the meaning of dib, other than its my abbreviated name, it also stands for Double Integer Bit, hence DINTBIT -- that is the title of my blog. 

We're going to cover articles about information security, pentesting , malware analysis , reverse engineering, CTFs, etc.

Let us learn together and enjoy hacking and cracking!
